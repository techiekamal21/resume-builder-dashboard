# Contributing to Resume Builder Dashboard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Resume Builder Dashboard as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly
4. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested
5. **Ensure the test suite passes**: `npm run lint`
6. **Make sure your code lints**: `npm run type-check`
7. **Update documentation** if needed
8. **Submit a pull request**!

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance

- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
